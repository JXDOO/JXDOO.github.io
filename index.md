### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was one of my favorites for a lot of reasons.
    The code on it was straight to the point and easy. It was
    also the first time I met some of my good friends during the Lab.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was very simple and funny. It was just adding your name
    to the code. Me and my partner had not had our linux laptops yet
    and we thought we couldn't complete the code.

* Lab 7

    I really liked the blackjack part of this code. We learned it all in class
    and had to just apply what we learned to the code on the repository. We
    basically just reskinned the code learned in class.
